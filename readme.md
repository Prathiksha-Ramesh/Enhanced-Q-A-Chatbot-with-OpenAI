- **Customizable Response Parameters**: The application allows users to adjust the `temperature` and `max_tokens` settings:
  - **Temperature**: Controls the creativity of the AI's responses (0.0 for less creativity and 1.0 for maximum creativity).
  - **Max Tokens**: Limits the length of the response, with a range between 50 and 300 tokens.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is built with Streamlit, which provides a clean and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Response Generation**: The chatbot responds to user queries in real-time, making it an efficient tool for instant information retrieval.
- **Environment Tracing with LangChain**: The application is configured to utilize LangChain for tracing, allowing for detailed logging and monitoring of AI interactions.
